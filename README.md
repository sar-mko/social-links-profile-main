## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I found an easier time centering the whole page by giving it an absolute position with the center hack. Solved the problem of the footer floating to the top by applying centering styles to a div that wraps both the card and the footer - rather than just the card.

```css
.center{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
